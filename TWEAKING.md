# Tweaking Guide

**Drums (01_drums.py)**
- `SWING` ≈ 0.02–0.04 for relaxed pulse.
- `ROLL_P` controls end-bar rolls.
- Accent patterns rotate for variety.

**Bass (02_bass.py)**
- Keep bar shape `1 | 2→3 | 5 | 6→1` for calm motion.

**Arp (03_arp_pads.py)**
- 3–3–2 per bar; first of each 3 lands on pedal. Change `pattern_degs` for variety.

**Lead (04_lead.py)**
- Lower `DENSITY` for more space; change `SEED` for variation.
- Graces on strong positions (start and mid-bar).

**Strings (05_strings_stinger.py)**
- Toggle `MAJOR = True` for a brighter closure.
